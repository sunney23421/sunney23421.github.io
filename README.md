If you will ask me to paticipat in any projects related to IT I'm available to innove new idea. Since, I'm a self learner I've done many prtojects and I took a knowladge/tips from each of them. That means I'm capble of in every accpect of each language. I'm not a person who focuses in only one thing or one language. I'm a multitasking person who like to learn. Knowledge is a power. More you know more oportunities and doors will open to the bright future. The word "Can't do it" doesnt exist in my vocabulary. If you give me enough time. :wink:

Now I'm [Ecole 42 Bangkok](https://www.42bangkok.com/) student in KMITL Universtiy.
